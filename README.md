# Cipherdle
Worldle with a cipheric twist. Like Wordle, your goal is to guess a hidden 5-letter word. Each of your guesses must be a valid 5-letter word. In addition to a hidden word, each game your are given a cipher of the alphabet. The colors of the letters in your guesses tell you about the letters of the hidden word _through the chipher_. For example, if you guess "vixen" and the v is green, that means that whatever the letter "v" points to in the cipher is the first letter of the hidden word. If the "v" turned yellow, that would tell you that the whatever letter "v" points to is in the hidden word, but it's not the first letter. Still, your goal is to guess the hidden word, not the "word" that maps to it when fed through the cipher, therefore, it's very unlikely for the hidden words to appear as all green.
